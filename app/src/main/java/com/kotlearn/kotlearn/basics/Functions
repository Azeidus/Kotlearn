Kotlin Methods / Functions

Kotlin functions are declared using the fun keyword:

fun initVariables() {

}

Functions are called using the standard approach:
val result = double(2)

fun double(x: Int): Int {
    return 2 * x
}

Calling member functions uses dot notation:
Stream().read()   >> creating instance of class Stream and call read()
