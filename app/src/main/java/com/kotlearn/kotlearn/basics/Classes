Kotlin Classes

Class - blueprint of an object
Object - implementation of blueprint
Constructors - Constructor is used to initialize the variables at the time of object creation.

Constructors
Primary Constructor - Lets the user pass in data to the Object as soon as the Object is created.
                    - you can only have one primary constructor.

Secondary Constructor - Lets the user pass in data to the Object but, it gets called after the primary constructor.
                      - you can have many secondary constructors.

Constructor Overloading
- Allows the user to create many constructors.
- Each constructor must have different parameters.
